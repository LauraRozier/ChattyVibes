# ChattyVibes
Allows you to connect your Twitch stream to your Intiface *smile*

## Dependencies
- IntiFace Desktop by Buttplug.io - To act as an interface between ChattyVibes and your toys. [link](https://intiface.com/desktop/)
- Toys - Why else would you need this? :smile:
- A Twitch Account - Because this app is Twitch-specific, you'll need an account there. [link](https://www.twitch.tv/)

## Setup
1. Start Intiface and set it up to your needs
2. Click "Start Server" within Iniface to start the websocket server we will use for communications.
